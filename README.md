# Factorio-Science-Off

A competitive science usage mod that tracks science packs used and awards points for them.

Freatures
============

- A small GUI will show your progress and any time or point goal you are competing against.
- Your progress in science packs and points can be seen in the production graph.
- You can load Target Run Data from a previous play and compete against it, with the target science packs and points shown in the production graph with a graph logo over them. At the end of the run you will get the option to export this data for use in future runs.
- At the end of a run (time or points limit reached) the game will freeze and you can review your base and production graph. See the runtime settings for the 2 types of game freezing (Editor Mode or Spectator).


Notes
===========

- Changing any startup mod settings once the map has been created is not supported. You must start a new map if any startup mod settings need changing. Given the short term playing time of the mod this shouldn't be an issue.
- Currently only supports vanilla science pack types, but is expandable in theory.
- Currently only supports 1 team ("player") per map. However, the code is written with expansion for multiple forces in mind.
