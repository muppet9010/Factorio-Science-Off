# Factorio-Science-Off

A competitive science usage mod that tracks science packs used and awards points for them. A small GUI will show your progress and any time or point goalyou are competing against. Your progress in science packs and points can be seen in the production graph.

You can load Target Run Data from a previous play and compete against it, with the target science packs and points shown in the production graph with a graph logo over them. At the end of the run you will get the optin to export this data for use in future runs.

At the end of a run (time or points limit reached) the game will freeze and you can review your base and production graph. See the runtime settings for the 2 types of game freezing (Editor Mode or Spectator).


Notes
===========

- Changing any mod settings once the map has been created is not supported. You must start a new map if any mod settings need changing.
- Currently only supports vanilla science pack types, but is expandable in theory.
- Currently only supports 1 team (player) per map. However, the code is written with multiple forces in mind.
