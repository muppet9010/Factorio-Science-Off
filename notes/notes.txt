TODO:
	- Add a command that can be run at any point to get the current game run data as JSON.
	- Disable rocket silo win condition as setting.
	- Change the JSOn export data to use an alias index for the science pack types. Should make the JSON data much shorter. Needs to handle load run data from both.

Ideas:
    - Maybe show the target run science, time, points on an optional GUI under the main one? So it can be raced in real time current total, plus on the production graph.
    - Made to support multiple forces on a map, but hardcoded to just use the default "player" one at present. Would need to have a round lobby type thing to get in to teams, change all the settings, etc. Then at end of game you can view detials and reset.
    - Add a spectator group that gets all teams stats on GUI and produciton tab. Maybe all teams should be able to see other teams in their produciton, plus the target.
